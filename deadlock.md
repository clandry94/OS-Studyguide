# Deadlock
## Concepts
### What is a deadlock? 
A set of processes is deadlocked if each process in the set is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause.  

### When does deadlock occur? Or, what are the conditions for deadlock to occur?

| Type | Description |
|:---|:---|
|1. Mutual Exclusion Condition | Each resources is concurrently assigned to *exactly one* process or is available |
|2. Hold and Wait Condition| Processes currently holding resources granted earlier can request new resources|
|3. No Preemption Condition| Resources previously granted cannot be focibly taken away from a process. They must be explicitly released by the process holding them|
|4. Circular Wait Condition| There must be a circular chain of two or more processes, each of which is waiting for a resource held by the next member of the chain|

### How to handle deadlocks? 
**1. Just ignore the problem (Ostrich Algorithm)**  
**2. Detection and Recovery**  

Deadlock Detection

| Method | Description |
|:---|:---|
|Detection with a single instance of each resource type/class | A resource-allocation graph is checked to see whether cycles exist|
|Detection with multiple instances of each resource type/class | A matrix-based algorithm is used to determine whether any unmarked processes exist| 

Deadlock Recovery

| Method | Description |
|:---|:---|
|Recovery through terminating / Killing processes| 1. Abort all deadlocked processes  2. Abort one process at a time until deadlock cycle is eliminated  3. A process *not* in the cycle can be chosen as a victim in order to release its resources|
|Recovery through resource preemption| |
|Recovery through rollback| | 

**3. Prevention**  

By Structurally negating one of the four conditions necessary to cause a deadlock

| Method | Description |
|:---|:---|
|Attacking the *mutural exclusion* condition | share all the resources |
| Attacking the *hold and wait* condition | 1. Each process is required to request and be allocated all its resources before execution begins.  2. Each process is to request resources only when it has none.  |
|Attacking the *no preemption* condition | Take resources away |
|Attacking the *circular wait* condition| 1. Each process can request resources only in an *increasing* order of enumeration.  2. No process can request a resource *lower* than what it is already holding |

**4. Dynamic Avoidance**    

Use the banker's algorithm for a single or multiple resources  

## Theory

### Deadlock  

A set of processes is deadlocked if each process in the set is waiting for an event that only another process in the set can cause.  

In most cases, the event its waiting for is the release of a resource currently being processed by another member of the set. 

### Resources  

Deadlocks occur when processes have been granted exlcusive access to devices, files, and so forth. These objects are known as *resources*. A resource can be pretty much anything from a device to information like a database record.  

Resources can be  

| Resource Type | Description |
| :---|:---|
|Preemptable Resource| One that can be taken away from the process owning it with no side effects. </br> Memory is a good example of preemptable resource. </br></br> Example: Suppose process A and process B are deadlocked because A owns shared memory and B needs it. B can take away A's memory by swapping A out and swapping B in. No deadlock occurs then.  |
|Non Preemptable resource| One that cannot be taken away from its current owner without causing the computation to fail </br></br> Example: If a process is burning a CD-ROM, taking the CD recorder away from it and giving it to another process will result in a messed up CD. CD recorders and similar devices are non-preemptable at any moment </br></br> Usually deadlocks involve nonpremptable resources since preemptable deadlocks can be mitigated easily.|

### Conditions for Deadlocks  

There are four conditions that *must* hold for a deadlock to occur

| Type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Mutual Exclusion Condition | Each resource is either currently assigned to *exactly one* proces or is available. </br></br> At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode; i.e., only *one* process at a time can use the resource. If another process requests the resource, the requesting process must be delayed until the resource is released |
| Hold and Wait condition | Processes currently holding resources granted earlier can request new resources </br></br> A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resource that are currently being held by other processes| 
| No preemption condition | Resources that are previously granted cannot be forcibly takena way from a process. They must be explicitly released by the process holdinf them </br></br> Resources cannot be preempted; i.e., a resource can be releaed only voluntarily after it has completed its task. |
| Circular Wait condition | There must be a circular chain of two or more processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next member of the chain </br></br> A set {P<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>1</sub>, ..., P<sub>n</sub> } of waiting processes must exist such that P<sub>0</sub> is waiting for a resource held by P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>1</sub> is waiting for a resource held by P<sub>2</sub>, ..., P<sub>n-1</sub> is waiting for a resource held by P<sub>n</sub>, and P<sub>n</sub> is waiting for a resource held by P<sub>0</sub>. |  

For a deadlock to occur ALL FOUR ***must***  be present for a deadlock to occur. If one is absent, no deadlock is possible. 

### Deadlock Modeling / Deadlock Characterization using Resource-Allocation Graphs
 
Four conditions for the deadlock can be modeled using directed graphs.   

![resource allocation graph](http://imgur.com/nFPoq3c.png)  

In the resource allocation graph for single instance resources, if a cycle exists, then a deadlock exists.   

For resource allocation graphs of multiple instances, note the following:
1. Number of instances of a resource is depicted with dots inside of the rectangle (as seen above)  
2. A request edge points only to the rectangle; whereas an assignment edge must also designate the dot in the rectangle.  
3. In multiple instance resources, if a resource allocation graph does not have acycle, the system is **not** deadlocked. If there is a cycle, it **may or may not** be in a deadlocked state.   

### Methods for Handling Deadlocks  

Four strategies exists for avoiding deadlocks. 

1. Ostrich Algorithm  
2. Detection and Recovery  
3. Prevention  
4. Dynamic Avoidance  

#### Ostrich Algorithm  

This is the simplest approach to handling deadlocks. Stick your head in the sand and hope it fixes itself. This approach, however, usually does not work well for life.  

|Advantages| Disadvantages| 
|:---|:---|
|In many systems, deadlocks don't occur often, so this method is cheaper than the other options. Many operating systems like UNIX and Windows use this approach. | We might get a deadlocked state yet not even know it. The undetected deadlock will deteriorate system performance because processes cannot continue and more processes will pile up in a deadlocked state. Eventually the system will stop functioning| 

#### Deadlock Detection and Recovery 

This technique does not try to actively prevent deadlocks, instead we let them happen and then take action to correct them. For this method to work, the system must provide:

1. An algorithm that examines the state of the system to determine whether a deadlock has occured or not. 
2. An algorithm to recover from the deadlock.  

##### Deadlock Detection  

*Detection with a single instance of each resource type*  

For this system, make a resource allocation graph. If the graph has 1 or more cycles, any process part of that cycle is deadlocked. If no cycles, the system is not deadlocked.  

We can use DFS (or BFS) to detect a cycle in the graph as well as the processes part of the deadlock.  

*Deadlock detection with multiple instances of each resource type*  

When multiple copies of some resource exists, a different approach must be taken to detect the deadlocks. The below matrix-based algorithm will detect deadlock among n processes, P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>n</sub>.  

Let,  
***m*** be the number of resource types/classes  
***E*** be the existing resource vector, it gives the total number of instances of *each* resource in existence.  
***E<sub>i</sub>*** gives the total number of instances of resrource of *i* class.  
***A*** is the available resource vector, it gives the number of instances currently available for each easource  
***A<sub>i</sub>***  gives the number of instances of resource *i*  currently available.  
***C*** is the current allocation matrix. The i-th row of C tells how many instances of each resource class P<sub>i</sub> currently holds. Thus, C<sub>ij</sub> is the number of instances of resource *j* that are held by process *i*  
***R*** is the request matrix. The i-th row of R tells how many instances of each resource class P<sub>i</sub> needs. Thus R<sub>ij</sub> is the number of instances of resource j that P<sub>i</sub> wants.  

There is an invariant for the four data structures. A resource is either allocated or it is available. This means that  

 âˆ‘C<sub>ij</sub> + A<sub>j</sub> = E<sub>j</sub>  
 
 In other words, if we add up all instances of resource j that have been allocated with all instances available, then we should get all of the resources that exist
 
 ![resourcegraph](http://imgur.com/KN2eWAK.png)  
 
 This algorithm compares vectors. Let the relation A <= B on two vectors A and B mean that each element of A is less than or equal to the corresponding element of B. Thus, A <= B holds if A<sub>i</sub> <= B<sub>i</sub> for 1 <= i <= m  
 
 Each process begins unmarked, as the algorithm goes on, the processes are marked. This indicates taht they are complete and not deadlocked. When the algorithm terminates, any unmarked processes are known to be deadlocked.  
 
 The deadlock detection algorithm can be given now, as follows:  
 
| Deadlock detection algorithm| 
|:---|
|1. Look for an unmarked process, P<sub>i</sub>, for which the i-th row of R is less than or equal to A |
|2. If such a process if found, add the ith row of C to A, mark the process, adn go back to step 1.  |
|3. If no such process exists, the algorithm terminates. |  
 
 When the algorithm finishes, all the unmarked processes, if any, are deadlocked.   
 
 
 *When to look for deadlocks*  
 
 1. Check every time a request is made 

 | Advantage | Disadvantage | 
 |:---:|:---:|
 |Detects deadlocks as early as possible |  High CPU time and overhead |
 
 2. Check every k minutes 
 3. Check only when the CPU utilization has dropped below a certain threshold  
 	* The eason we can consider the CPU utilizaiton is that if enough processes deadlock, there a few runnable procces, so we will likely find one when the CPU utilization is low.  

 	
##### Deadlock Recovery  

*Recovery through termination / Killing processes*  

1. Abort all deadlocked processes  
	* **Disadvantage**: This is *expensive*. The deadlocked processes may have computed for a long time, and these partial computations will be lost and have to be recomputed  
2. Abort one process at a time until the deadlock cycle is terminated
	* **Disadvantage**: The *overhead* here is high. After each process is aborted, the deadlock detection algorithm must run again.  
3. A process *not* in the cycle can be chosen as a victim to release more resources  
	* One process might hold a printer and want a plotter, with another process holding a plotter wanting a printer. These two are deadlocked. A third process may hold another identical printer and another identical plotter and be happilty running. Killing the third process will release resources and break the deadlock in the first two.
